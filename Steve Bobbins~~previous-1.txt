You see one city buried under a massive lava flow, starships buzzing around it like a cloud of flies to carry people and goods to safety. Other cities are destroyed by war, and then abruptly the dragon-people are all gone and their cities lie vacant. Buildings crumble, and the forests reclaim the land."

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."
		description "Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."

		description "Rand is a desert world, too dry for much farming and with gravity low enough to be uncomfortable for most human beings. It is, however, the best source of heavy metals in the galactic south. Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves."
		description "	Recent terraforming experiments have caused an increase in precipitation. Flash floods have scoured the landscape in some areas, but sandstorms are also less frequent, and the locals say the heat is a bit less oppressive than it used to be."

The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."

When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so."
		description "	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here."
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description "Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here."
		description "The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners."
		spaceport "It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering."

		description "	Until recently, this was a pirate world, but as the Free Worlds continued to expand they saw the writing on the wall and decided to become a civilized world.

The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations."

		description "The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going."
		description "	Winter is home to the Free Worlds Conservatory, a new university that is focused on making terraforming technology and expertise available at a reasonable price, as well as on ecological protection and renewal."

		description "	Recently, with the help of the Free Worlds, a new spaceport was completed here. Bloodsea was formerly a pirate world, but the new spaceport has given it an air of respectability, and already a small number of settlers and curious tourists have begun flowing in."
		spaceport "The new spaceport is impressively well designed, with seawalls and landing pads of crisp, newly-set concrete, still unmarked by weather or mildew. It is also several times larger than necessary for the number of people and ships that are here, and aside from a lively market, it feels strangely empty."
		spaceport `	Some things remain unchanged from back in the pirate days. The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`

		description "Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in a twilight haze of ash and fog."
		description "	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry."
		spaceport "Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled."
		spaceport "	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon."

		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	16 11 3013
		"Getting some basic instructions on making a living as a merchant from an old captain named James."
	13 12 3013
		"Dropped James off on Hestia after running a few missions with him. Met a few spoiled tourists and got to visit Earth along the way."
	16 7 3015
		"Agreed to run interference for the Free Worlds by pretending to be a smuggler while actually carrying harmless medical supplies. It seems like this might be a ploy to make the Navy look bad."
	7 12 3015
		`Met up with a friend of Katya's named Mr. Eyes, who calls himself a "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector." He thinks he can help hunt down the people who bombed Geminus and Martini, to prove that the Free Worlds were not behind it.`
	27 12 3015
		"Katya's plan for hunting down the nuclear terrorists involves stealing the sensor equipment from a Navy surveillance drone. Supposedly taking equipment from a drone counts as a salvage operation as long as none of its owners are present, due to a legal loophole in an old act of Parliament."
	31 3 3016
		"Found evidence of nuclear testing on Clink, a mining moon on the edge of Free Worlds territory. It's strange that the perpetrators left such clear evidence behind; the Navy's drones will certainly have discovered it before we did. Katya stayed behind to try to infiltrate the mining compound and collect more information."
	28 4 3016
		"Hunting down a fleet of pirates called the Rat Pack, who have been giving the Free Worlds trouble lately."
	29 4 3016
		"Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys, recently."
	25 5 3016
		"Volunteered to do some recon work for the Free Worlds, as long as there is nothing illegal involved."
	7 7 3016
		"Helped rescue a Free Worlds freighter that had been disabled by pirates. Earned the gratitude of Tomek Voigt, the council member in charge of the supply convoys."
	25 10 3016
		"Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help."
	4 4 3017
		"Got invited to join the Free Worlds. It's a valuable opportunity, but it would also be a fast way to become an enemy of the Republic."
	25 4 3017
		"The Navy has invaded Kornephoros, while Katya was still undercover on Clink. No sign of where she is. She may have been taken as a prisoner."
	27 4 3017
		"Officially joined the Free Worlds. Helping to defend Sabik, which is now under attack by the Navy. This Free Worlds work may mean getting involved in a lot more battles like this one."
	30 4 3017
		"The Free Worlds have retaken the Kornephoros system, with heavy losses on both sides. And unfortunately, there is no sign of Katya; she may have been taken prisoner by the Navy."
	7 5 3017
		"Returned some Navy prisoners of war, after they gave their parole and promised not to take part in any future battles against the Free Worlds."
	19 5 3017
		"Visited the Syndicate and worked out a deal where they promised to stay neutral. They are expecting to profit from selling weapons to both sides in this war. Also discovered that Katya is in the Republic's custody and is accused of terrorist activity."
	11 6 3017
		"Tried to convince Poisonwood, a world adjacent to Free Worlds territory, to switch sides. But, they are fiercely loyal to the Republic because the Navy freed them from being dominated by Alpha warlords decades ago."
	18 6 3017
		"Planted some sensors on the abandoned world of Hope, as an early warning system for Navy raids on Free Worlds space. The Navy appears to be doing something on this world, as well."
	30 6 3017
		"Apparently the paroled Navy prisoners from the battle for Kornephoros plan to keep their promise to not fight against the Free Worlds. They've formed a new Navy regiment guarding the far north of human space."
	16 7 3017
		"Assisted a Kraz Cybernetics engineer known as Barmy Edward with a test of a new and extremely powerful plasma cannon turret."
	20 8 3017
		"Tomek, from the Free Worlds council, is trying to decide how to best deal with the threat of the pirates to the south of Free Worlds space."
	8 10 3017
		"The Free Worlds have finally elected a Senate, which will be convening for the first time soon on Bourne."
	16 11 3017
		"Given orders by the Free Worlds Senate to escort a diplomatic mission to the anarchist planet Thule. Tomek is not happy about bargaining with the pirates instead of fighting them."
	24 11 3017
		"The elders on Thule do not want to join the Free Worlds, but they have agreed to crack down on pirate activity in their system and to welcome Free Worlds visitors to their planet."
	16 12 3017
		"Brought supplies to Smuggler's Den to help upgrade the station into a working deuterium refinery. No further orders from the Free Worlds, so this might be a good time to find ways to earn more money on the side."
	31 12 3017
		"Assisted Barmy Edward with another weapon test: this time, a flamethrower weapon that works by overheating and disabling its target rather than dealing lots of damage to it. It may or may not be useful in actual combat."
	18 1 3018
		"Stopped on Earth with Alondo to talk to Parliament and try to head off another bloody battle. But, they were not willing to negotiate."
	10 3 3018
		"Helped the Free Worlds gain access to new ramscoop technology that has been developed in the Deep. This should make it significantly easier to travel long distances through unfriendly systems."
	17 3 3018
		"It looks like the Navy has begun using some more powerful beam weapons and torpedoes. Tasked with plundering one of the electron beam weapons so Freya can get a closer look at it."
	19 4 3018
		"Preparing for another major battle with the Navy, this time in the Rastaban system, which just recently expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds but has not been able to do so due to the Navy presence. The Free Worlds will be using a new model of warship, the Dreadnought, in this battle."
	22 4 3018
		"The Navy has been driven out of the Rastaban system. That will allow the people on Dancer, New Portland, and New India to join the Free Worlds."
	1 5 3018
		"Was given the choice of what to do with the Navy prisoners from the battle for Rastaban, and decided to parole and release them rather than imprisoning them. Hopefully that will earn some goodwill from the Navy in the future."
	4 5 3018
		"Once again there is no immediate work to be done for the Free Worlds. This would be a good time to earn some money for an upgraded ship, if possible."
	7 7 3018
		"Three more planets have decided to defect to the Free Worlds: Clark, New Tibet, and New Holland."
	12 8 3018
		"The shipyard on Zug is still trying to ramp up Dreadnought production. So far only a few ships have been built, but Freya will be helping to speed up the process."
	20 8 3018
		"Agreed to become a member of the Free Worlds council, taking Tomek's spot."
	3 9 3018
		"The Republic world of Poisonwood in the south has apparently been taken over by Alpha warlords. It is such a dire threat that despite the war, the Navy Oathkeepers have agreed to fight alongside the Free Worlds to liberate the planet."
	12 9 3018
		"With the help of the Oathkeepers, liberated Poisonwood from the Alpha invaders."
	24 9 3018
		"The local leaders on the lawless world of Bloodsea have said that they will join the Free Worlds, and stop supporting piracy, in exchange for the equipment to build a more modern spaceport. However, they may just be trying to steal the construction materials; it might be simpler to just attack and conquer them."
	9 10 3018
		"Brought the construction supplies that the people of Bloodsea requested, and they have agreed to join the Free Worlds."
	9 10 3018
		"Freya has announced that Dreadnoughts are now for sale on Zug. Finally the Free Worlds have a warship that can stand up to Navy capital ships."
	15 11 3018
		"The people of Albatross, another anarchist world, have agreed to join the Free Worlds in gratitude for having been liberated from Ryk Bartlett, a warlord who was extorting them for protection money."
	19 11 3018
		"Another two planets, Rand and Oblivion, have expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds. They are rather far from the rest of Free Worlds territory, however, so JJ is worried that it would create an indefensible tactical position."
	25 11 3018
		"The Navy has invaded Rastaban and Delta Sagittarii, effectively slicing through Free Worlds territory and splitting up the Free Worlds fleet."
	2 12 3018
		"As a member of the Council, must make the deciding vote on a difficult decision. A defector from the Syndicate is claiming to have proof that the Syndicate was behind the bombings of Martini and Gemini. If that is true, the Republic may agree to make peace with the Free Worlds. But, refusing to return the defector to the Syndicate would certainly earn their enmity."
	12 12 3018
		"Decided to rescue the Syndicate defector rather than turning him over to the Syndicate. A Questioner who works with Navy Intelligence has confirmed that he is telling the truth, and a ceasefire has been declared. Also, the Navy has agreed to release Katya now that there is evidence proving her innocence."
	7 1 3019
		"Collected atmospheric samples from Mutiny, a planet deep in Syndicate space, and verified that a nuclear test has been performed here using isotopes that match those from the attacks on Geminus and Martini. Also found carefully hidden signs of an underground test site."
	18 1 3019
		"Parliament still refuses to believe that the Syndicate could have been behind the attacks; the Syndicate has far too much power and influence in the government of the Republic. But, the people of the Deep might be more open to the defector's story."
	28 1 3019
		`The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, has proposed a "police action" to arrest one or more of the Syndicate leaders and bring them to justice. It will be a secret joint operation between the Free Worlds, the Deep, and the Oathkeepers.`
	22 2 3019
		"Visited a village on a lawless world in northern Syndicate space, and purchased information on the whereabouts of several of the Syndicate executives who were implicated in the terrorist attacks."
	21 4 3019
		"Dropped off a team of Republic diplomats on Bourne. It seems like for now, the ceasefire is holding, and public opinion is slowly turning to favor the Free Worlds rather than the Syndicate. But the Syndicate leaders must still be brought to justice. The Council will be in touch when they are ready to help launch an attack on the Syndicate."
	18 5 3019
		"The Free Worlds will soon have a new reactor core of their own design available for sale. It probably will not be as advanced as Navy technology, however."
	24 6 3019
		"Preparing to invade Syndicate space with a joint strike force made up of Free Worlds, Deep security, and Oathkeeper ships. The plan is to capture one of the Syndicate executives and bring him to trial."
	16 7 3019
		`Succeeded in capturing a Syndicate executive named Alexander Soylent, but the Syndicate has responded by sending a massive fleet to Sol, supposedly to "protect" Earth but more likely to put pressure on Parliament and the people of Earth to side with the Syndicate.`
	27 7 3019
		"All communications with Rand, which recently joined the Free Worlds but is close to Syndicate territory, have been cut off. It is possible that this is the beginning of a Syndicate invasion."
	31 7 3019
		"No one on Tundra, which is one of Rand's neighbors, has any idea how the hyperspace link was cut off. They wonder if this might have something to do with a star system near Rand that was inaccessible by hyperdrive."
	7 8 3019
		"No one on Arabia knows what has caused hyperspace links in this region of space to suddenly disappear. There are stories of graviton surges and an alien ship, but they may all just be rumors."
	19 8 3019
		"The Syndicate may be cutting off the hyperspace links that join their territory to the rest of human space, in order to escape being punished for their crimes. People are worried that they will try to take over even more territory, including Earth itself."
	27 8 3019
		"Agreed to travel to Syndicate space through the one remaining hyperspace path that is still open, through the uninhabited star systems to the north."
	15 9 3019
		"The Syndicate CEO claims that the disappearing hyperspace links are not their doing, and that in fact they are under attack by aliens. In fact, they say that the Syndicate has had contact with two different alien species in this region - raiders and scavengers known as the Korath coming from the galactic core, and an enigmatic and irrational species named the Pug who occupy the system adjacent to the ones that recently got cut off from human space."
		"By plundering the Korath raiders, the Syndicate has acquired some jump drives, which allow a ship to travel between systems that are not connected by hyperspace links. They are willing to part with one of these jump drives in order to prove the truth of their story to the rest of humanity."
	21 9 3019
		"Visited one of the human worlds that has been captured by the Pug. The Pug do not seem to be mistreating the people here, but they have stationed armed guards throughout the spaceport."
	23 9 3019
		"Located the Pug homeworld, and met with some of them. They say that they have annexed the neighboring systems into the Pug Protectorate in order to stop the human civil war. However, their idea of bringing peace seems to involve conquering human space and replacing the Republic with their own government."
	5 10 3019
		"The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, says that the Pug secretly assisted the people of the Deep to fight against the Alphas centuries ago, during the Alpha Wars. He thinks that the Pug have humanity's best interests at heart, but agrees that they can't be allowed to overthrow the Republic."
	15 11 3019
		"Discovered a strange, isolated human community in an otherwise uninhabited region of space south of the Core. They call themselves the Remnant."
	10 3 3020
		"Learned from the Quarg that they have long been aware of the presence of the Pug in the Deneb system. Apparently the Pug are from another galaxy and possess such advanced technology that even the Quarg do not dare to interfere with them."
		"However, the Pug are known to treat warfare like a game, intentionally using weaker technology when fighting less advanced species in order to give them a fair chance at winning the battle. So, fighting them will not be a lost cause, but the Quarg are unwilling to provide any assistance."
	27 3 3020
		"The Free Worlds and Republic Navy are sending a joint fleet into Syndicate space, where they will be fitted with jump drives to make an assault on Pug territory. The Syndicate only has six jump drives available, so this fleet will have to survive without reinforcements until a way is found to reopen the connection to the rest of human space."
	6 4 3020
		"Succeeded in driving the Pug out of the Delta Capricorni system for long enough to land on Maker and explore the technology that the Pug left behind. Freya thinks that she has discovered the device that is used for creating or destroying hyperspace links, but it will take time for her to figure out how to operate it."
	12 4 3020
		"Freya succeeded in reopening the hyperspace link to one of the Syndicate systems. If the same can be done for the link to Sol, the entire Navy will be able to join the battle against the Pug."
	20 4 3020
		"Succeeded in rendezvousing with the Navy in the Sol system and reopening a link to the Pug territory. But now Shiver is under attack by a massive Pug fleet."
	22 4 3020
		"Preparing for the final assault on the Pug homeworld. There seems to be no other option but to force them to surrender, but with the help of the Navy that no longer seems like an impossible task."
	24 4 3020
		`The Pug have fled, apparently traveling through an artificial wormhole back to whatever galaxy they came from. And, it turns out that many of their cities on "Pugglemug" were only for show: buildings with no inhabitants, and with holograms creating the appearance of a heavily populated world. They left no advanced technology behind, and no sign of what their true intentions were, but it turns out that the fake cities here were designed for human habitation. They must have been planning this departure for a very long time.`
		`Now that the Pug are gone, the Navy will be able to use the "graviton reflectors" to repair the broken hyperspace links and to reconnect all of human space.`
	30 4 3020
		"With the Pug defeated, it is finally time to deal with the Syndicate extremists and the Alphas that they allied with. The extremists are armed with nuclear missiles, but the Syndicate CEO has agreed to provide a cloaking device that will make it possible to dodge the missiles."
	8 5 3020
		"Succeeded in drawing the fire of the Syndicate extremists for long enough for a Navy fleet to safely arrive in-system and assist in destroying them. This cloaking device will come in very handy in the future."
	16 5 3020
		"Received an official commendation from Parliament and a promise that the war with the Free Worlds is officially over. Humanity is at peace once more, but new challenges may await in the star systems out beyond human space that are accessible only by jump drive."
	21 2 3021
		"Discovered a birdlike alien species to the north of human space. They appear to speak the Hai language in addition to their own, so with the help of a Hai interpreter it might be possible to communicate with them."
	28 3 3021
		`Was able to communicate with the birdlike "Wanderers" with the help of a Hai ambassador. It turns out that they have been under attack by the Unfettered Hai for some time, and have learned the Hai language by taking captives.`
	2 5 3021
		"Received a device, created by a Hai scientist, which can translate between human language and the Hai language. Since the Wanderers speak the Hai language, that should make it possible to communicate with them directly."
	12 5 3021
		"Spoke with a Wanderer ambassador named Iktat Rek, using the translation device. Received permission to purchase some of their technology, but not their ships."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."
	Factions Arachi
		`The spider-like Arachi were the last of the three Coalition species to discover interstellar travel. Most members of their society owe allegiance to one of the great Arachi "Houses," organizations that are somewhat similar to guilds and that each specialize in one particular form of industry or technology.`
	Factions Archons
		`Archons are partly biological, but do not seem to be naturally evolved creatures. Some of their biological characteristics may have been based on the "void sprites" that inhabit the Ember Waste.`
		"Archons consider it to be their job to enforce peace and to prevent extinction. If they are unable to prevent a species from driving itself extinct, they will still try to preserve some of what that species created as a memorial to them."
		"They are capable of communicating telepathically."
	Factions Coalition
		"The Coalition is an alliance of three different alien species living in peace with each other: the Saryds, the Kimek, and the Arachi. On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs."
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Hai
		"The Hai are a species of giant, intelligent rodents, who live to the north of human space. They allow any humans who discover their territory to live alongside them, and to trade with them and purchase their technology."
	Factions Heliarchs
		"The Heliarchs are the rulers of Coalitions space: apparently not elected, but instead selected by merit from among the citizens of the Coalition in such a way as to ensure that all three species are equally represented. Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species."
	Factions Kimek
		"The Kimek are large insectoid aliens, and are members of the Coalition. They discovered spaceflight after the Saryds, but before the Arachi. They are intensely social creatures, preferring to live together in massive buildings with thousands of inhabitants, and many of their worlds have populations in the tens of billions, far more than any human world."
	Factions Korath
		`The Korath are reptilian, bipedal aliens whose territory is almost entirely in ruins: cities destroyed and entire planets scarred by what appears to have been a vicious civil war. Several factions of Korath survive. The "Kor Efreti" live in the shelter of a Quarg ringworld and are on peaceful terms with the Quarg. Other Korath, living as exiles near the galactic core, have been raiding human worlds to steal food and supplies. And deeper in Korath space, two massive armies of automated war drones, known as the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor, are locked in an unending struggle. They attack any visitors to their region of space, including the Quarg.`
	Factions "Navy Intelligence"
		"It is unclear why the Navy needs their own intelligence force, since the Republic already has a Department of Intelligence that is incredibly powerful and well-funded. Rumors say that one of the main purposes of Navy Intelligence is to watch for human rights abuses being committed by the Republic itself and for other questionable activities that the Department of Intelligence might turn a blind eye toward or even collude with."
	Factions Oathkeepers
		`The "Oathkeepers" are a regiment of Navy officers who were captured by the Free Worlds and paroled on the condition that they take no further part in fighting against the Free Worlds. They are led by William Danforth, a famous Navy admiral. Their stated mission is to protect the Paradise Worlds from the pirates who live on the anarchist worlds in the far north of human space.`
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
		"Pirate ships are often crewed by children, the equivalent of street gangs or child soldiers. Many lawless worlds are so poor that joining a pirate gang is one of the only attractive options for earning a living."
	Factions Pug
		"The Pug are aliens with barrel-shaped bodies, spindly legs, and milky blue blood. They claim to have intervened in the human civil war purely for the sake of preventing more bloodshed and helping humans to live together in peace."
		"It is possible that the Pug secretly assisted the humans of the Deep centuries ago by providing them with weapons that helped to turn the tide of the Alpha Wars."
		"The Quarg claim that the Pug are powerful enough that they could defeat the Quarg, or even the Drak, if they chose to. But the Pug treat warfare like a game. When battling another species, the Pug will limit themselves to ships and weapons that are weak enough that the other species has a chance of defeating them."
		"The Pug disappeared from human space, and left behind more questions than answers. It is possible that the true purpose of their attack was to give human beings a common enemy that would force them to band together and forget their internal struggles."
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Remnant
		"Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society."
		"Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species."
		"Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Saryds
		"Saryds are an alien species who look suspiciously similar to the centaurs found in early human mythology. They prefer to live on worlds with as much green space as possible, and even their major cities are full of parks and gardens. Most Saryds live in small communes with up to a few dozen of them per house."
	Factions Sheragi
		`The Unfettered Hai say that a dragon-like species called the "Sheragi" who are long extinct used to live in human space, back when much of what is now human territory was occupied by the Hai.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
	Factions "Unfettered Hai"
		`The "Unfettered" are a faction within the Hai species who are not as peaceful as the rest, and are normally not friendly toward humans. They claim that long ago the Drak altered the Hai to make them docile and peaceful, and that the Unfettered are descendants of those Hai who avoided undergoing that alteration. They are seeking jump drives so that they can escape the "prison" they are now stuck in: a few deteriorating worlds on the far northern edge of Hai space.`
	Factions "Void Sprites"
		`The "void sprites" are space-dwelling lifeforms. They are apparently not sentient. They evolved in the atmosphere of a gas giant, but have some biological mechanism for altering or reflecting gravity that allows them to fly into outer space, in the same way that human ships use antigravity to escape a planet's gravity well. The void sprites are not particularly powerful or dangerous creatures, but they are guarded by a Drak Archon.`
	Factions Wanderers
		`The Wanderers are a bird-like species who inhabit a small region of space adjacent to the Hai. They have been under attack by the "Unfettered" Hai for some time. The Wanderers claim to be peaceful, and most of their ships are not designed for military use.`
		`The Wanderers believe that their purpose in the universe is to "repair" planets whose biospheres have been ravaged by other species either through mismanagement or as a result of war. They came to their current territory through a wormhole that they call "the Eye," and they say that once their work here is done the Eye will open and lead them to a new territory and new worlds for them to care for.`
		"It is possible that the worlds they currently inhabit were formerly part of Hai territory. That might explain why the Unfettered believe they have a right to take that territory back."
	People "Albert Foster"
		"An archaeologist who is famous for using dubious methods: he has been banned from Quarg space for trying to collect an alloy sample from their ringworld, and is rumored to have also been involved in a scheme involving dinosaur fossils and an illegal genetic resequencer. He is currently based on Vinci, on the edge of the Paradise sector."
	People "Alondo Gruyere"
		`Alondo grew up on Bourne, the relatively prosperous planet on the edge of the Rim that is now the capital of the Free Worlds. He served as a Republic diplomat for years before becoming convinced that Parliament was just using him the "pacify" the less developed worlds in the South with empty promises. He joined the Southern Defense Pact in the early days, before it became the Free Worlds, and is now a member of the Council.`
	People "Edward Tivrusky"
		`Barmy Edward is the Chief Offensive Engineer at Kraz Cybernetics, known for his inventive and sometimes impractical weapon designs. Supposedly, his engineers gave him the "Barmy" sobriquet after an incident where an experimental epoxy cannon he was working on exploded and glued him to the ceiling.`
	People "Freya Winters"
		`Freya is an engineer, specializing in surveillance equipment but with a wide range of talents. She organized the "thousand eyes" program run by the Southern Defense Pact, which was an attempt to reduce the power of the pirate fleets in the region by tracking their fleet movements. Despite her relative lack of interest in politics, she was asked to join the Free Worlds Council because of her expertise in optimizing the distribution and management of resources.`
	People "Ijs Springborn"
		`Also known as "Mr. Eyes," Ijs worked for years as a self-appointed "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector," trying to catch and report environmental abuses that the government officials were turning a blind eye to. He has now agreed to join the Free Worlds movement.`
		"Ijs is now working to found the Conservatory, a publicly funded Free Worlds university that will have a particular focus on terraforming technology. Their goal is to make terraforming methods efficient enough that even Dirt Belt worlds will be able to afford them."
	People "Iktat Rek"
		"Rek is a Wanderer ambassador, a new and unusual profession among a species that until recently has had no contact with aliens except for the occasional Unfettered Hai raid. His job is to help the Wanderers develop a deeper relationship with humans."
	People "Jean-Jacques Soleau"
		`Known to most people simply as "JJ," Jean-Jacques grew up in the Dirt Belt and served in the Navy for years before quitting in frustration over the fact that the Navy was no longer defending his home region of space. He now serves on the Free Worlds Council, where he is tasked with coordinating actions between the local militias and shaping them into a single fighting force that can act in concert with each other.`
	People "Katya Reynolds"
		`A former member of Parliament representing the impoverished Dirt Belt worlds, Katya is now a leader in the Free Worlds movement. She is well-known for standing up for the "common people" when they are being overlooked or mistreated by the government or by corporations.`
		"Katya grew up on Hope, a Dirt Belt world that is no longer inhabited because of a supervolcano eruption that triggered a new ice age. Despite her distrust of the Republic she has high regard for the Navy because they were the ones, acting without clearance from Parliament, who helped the settlers on Hope to evacuate safely."
		"Katya was on Clink when the Navy invaded the Kornephoros system, and was taken captive by them and imprisoned as a war criminal."
	People Raven
		"Raven, whose full name is unknown, is a Questioner who works for Navy Intelligence. Through some combination of training and natural ability, she is able to reliably detect whether or not someone is telling the truth."
	People Sayari
		"Ambassador Sayari, a Hai, served as their envoy to the human government a century ago (although no public records of this exist in human space). She has now been assigned by the Hai to be their diplomat to the Wanderers, and to serve as a translator as well."
	People "Tomek Voigt"
		"Tomek is a young and ambitious militia commander. His brilliant tactical leadership and charismatic personality gained him quite a following in the Dirt Belt region even before the Free Worlds came into existence. He was asked to join the Council in part because of his popularity with the local militias throughout the region."
		"Tomek was removed from the Council and placed under house arrest by the Senate after he disobeyed their orders and tried to launch an attack to capture the Pirate world of Greenrock rather than pursuing the diplomatic solution that the Senate preferred."
	People "William Danforth"
		`Danforth is a famous Navy Admiral who is a folk hero throughout human space due to his fair and honorable behavior and his willingness to use his fleet to assist people in need, even when he has to go against Parliament's orders to do so. He is currently in charge of the Navy regiment who call themselves the "Oathkeepers."`
